# Parameters

In zsh, a parameter has a name, a value, and attributes. We often call a parameter whose name begins with an alphanumeric or underscore a variable.

## `param_name=value` - Simple assignment

*No spaces are before and after `=` (assignment sign).*

*`value` is always a string.*

```sh
% a=1
```
